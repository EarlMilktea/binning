# üóÇÔ∏è binning: Correlated data analyzer written in TypeScript

## üö∏ Binning Basics

Suppose you have a sequence of numbers drawn from a distribution:

```jsonc
// data.json (snipped)
[0.30471707975443135, -1.0399841062404955, ..., -0.18284989730929277]
```

Binning helps you with estimating the mean of the distribution, _without_ assuming that the data are uncorrelated.

To begin with, install `npm` and run this package via `npx`:

```bash
$ npx binning -i data.json
{
  // Snipped output
  "total-mean": -0.010249875414011674,
  "total-var-raw": 1.0127123191921061,
  "total-std-raw": 1.0063360865993558,
  "bin-width": [1, 2, ..., 8192],
  "num-bins": [10000, 5000, ..., 1],
  "var-binned": [0.00010127123191921062, 0.00010302572984499039, ..., 0],
  "std-binned": [0.010063360865993558, 0.010150159104417545, ..., 0],
  "inefficiency": [1, 1.0173247416124989, 1.00605900827216, ..., 0]
}
```

Output is a stringified JSON object with the following fields:

- `total-mean`

Mean of the entire dataset.
This is an unbiased estimate of the mean of the distribution.

- `total-var-raw`

Variance of the entire dataset.

- `total-std-raw`

Square root of `total-var-raw`.

- `bin-width`

Used chunk sizes: the data are divided into non-overlapping subarrays of these sizes during the analysis.

- `num-bins`

Number of bins for each `bin-width`.
Note that `bin-width` times `num-bins` can be different from the original length as reminder data are discarded.

- `var-binned`

Binned variance.
The data are first split into bins, then averaged bin-wise, and finally variance is calculated using the bin averages.

- `std-binned`

Square root of `var-binned`.
In the limit of large `bin-width` and `num-bins`, this gives the standard error of `total-mean` with correlations taken into account.

- `inefficiency`

The correlated error estimate divided by the uncorrelated counterpart.

In the above example, as `std-binned` are approximately equal to 0.01 for large `bin-width` and `num-bins`, the final estimate of the original mean is -0.01(1) .

## üî® Usage

See `npx binning -h` for the full list of options.

### 1D Data

```bash
# Read JSON from stdin
echo "[1, 2, 3]" | npx binning
# Read CSV from stdin
echo "1,2,3" | npx binning
# Read space-separated numbers from stdin
echo "1 2 3" | npx binning
```

### 2D Data

```bash
# Analyze the column 1 of JSON
echo -e "[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]" | npx binning -c 1
# Analayze the row 0 of CSV
echo -e "1,2,3\n4,5,6" | npx binning -r 0
```

### File IO

```bash
# Read from input.json and write to output.json
npx binning -i input.json -o output.json
```
